# Log file explanations

I've conducted 3 experiments:
* First, only with pressure and velocity variations
* Only pressure tests
* Pressure, velocity, and naive time calculations.

Refer to [Report.pdf](Report.pdf) for an in-depth analysis.

Running the code:

	python extract.py timed/slow-swipe.txt 3

2 arguments are to be given: location of log file, and the number of parameters in that file extracted.
The output is saved in a file, temp.html, for easier viewing experience.
